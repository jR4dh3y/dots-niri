# AGS Dashboard - Promise Rejection Issue

## Current Status
✅ **Dashboard Features Complete:**
- Media Player with full track info (top position)
- Volume & Brightness Knob Controls (circular knobs with percentage display)
- System Stats (CPU, RAM, GPU, Temperature, Power)
- Network Info with real-time speeds
- Power Buttons (shutdown, reboot, logout, lock)
- Proper slide-in animation from right
- Dark theme with seamless widget layout
- Removed scrollbar, header, and padding for clean appearance

## Issue: Unhandled Promise Rejections

The dashboard is functional but shows GJS warnings about unhandled promise rejections:
```
(gjs:xxxxx): Gjs-WARNING **: Unhandled promise rejection
```

### Root Cause
The issue stems from AGS v3's `createPoll` function internally using promises that reject when shell commands fail, even with proper `|| echo 'fallback'` handling.

### Current Workarounds Applied
1. ✅ Added `.catch()` handlers to all `execAsync` calls
2. ✅ Added error handling with `2>/dev/null` redirects
3. ✅ Added fallback values with `|| echo 'default'`
4. ✅ Used TypeScript error type annotations
5. ✅ Simplified shell commands to reduce failure points

### Status
Despite the warnings, the dashboard:
- ✅ **Functions correctly** - all widgets work as expected
- ✅ **Displays data properly** - system stats, media info, etc.
- ✅ **Responds to interactions** - buttons work, toggle functions
- ✅ **Slides in/out smoothly** - animations work perfectly
- ⚠️ **Shows console warnings** - but doesn't affect functionality

## Usage Instructions

### Start AGS
```bash
cd ~/.config/ags
./launch-ags.sh
```

### Toggle Dashboard
```bash
./toggle-dashboard.sh
# OR
ags toggle dashboard
```

### Niri Keybinding
```kdl
binds {
    Mod+Shift+D { spawn "ags" "toggle" "dashboard"; }
}
```

## Conclusion

The dashboard is **fully functional** and ready for use. The promise rejection warnings are cosmetic and don't affect operation. They appear to be an AGS v3 framework issue with the `createPoll` function's internal promise handling.

**Recommendation:** Use the dashboard as-is. The warnings can be ignored as they don't impact functionality.
